* migrate preferences from old app?
* enable / disable scheduled sync
* scheduled sync should be every 24 hours
* ensure that starting via launchctl doesn't conflict with scheduled runs
* use launchctl enable/disable flag instead of load/unload?
* make all logging consistent
* use NSDictionary.dictionaryWithContentsOfFile(File.expand_path(info_plist_path))
* only read/write the bits of preferences/keychain that we need to
* think about when things should happen e.g. awakeFromNib vs mainViewDidLoad
* think about notification when there is an exception in sync
* extract most of sync.sh into a class/file
* fail fast/raise exception e.g. when preferences don't save
* use WatchPaths in launch agent to sync after iphone app installed (maybe combine with a check that last sync was at least x minutes ago)
