* ensure menu app is universal binary same as pref pane
* launchctl compatibility with Tiger - do we actually need the -S option? try removing everything including keychain and trying without -S option
* problem with Tiger not seeing classes from PreferencePane framework
* LaunchAgent should take responsibility for working out whether task is already loaded - but we also need to ensure that new versions of the script get written to file - do we need to do all the same things in menu app as in pref pane app?
* does auto check for updates happen when sys prefs is launched? might make sense to keep menu app alive all the time and just show/hide icon/menu - but this might not work with Sparkle
* check that it doesn't matter that we keep reloading launchd stuff every time system prefs app is started
* enable / disable scheduled sync
* make sync interval configurable
* use NSDictionary.dictionaryWithContentsOfFile(File.expand_path(info_plist_path))
* fail fast/raise exception e.g. when preferences don't save
* fail fast/raise exception e.g. when launchd script fails?
* use WatchPaths in launch agent to sync after iphone app installed (maybe combine with a check that last sync was at least x minutes ago)
* launchd script should send an NSDictionary with success and timestamp so observer can format time and do other presentational stuff. This means these dictionary values would need to be stored in preferences
* same files are in both apps
* could derive status_bar_enabled from launch agent list
