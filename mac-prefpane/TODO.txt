* namespace all classes in Installd module
* enable / disable scheduled sync
* scheduled sync should be every 24 hours

* ensure that starting via launchctl doesn't conflict with scheduled runs
* use launchctl enable/disable flag instead of load/unload?
* make all logging consistent
* rakefile builds
* use NSDictionary.dictionaryWithContentsOfFile(File.expand_path(info_plist_path))
* only read/write the bits of preferences/keychain that we need to
